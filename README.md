Backbone.associate 
==================

Presumptionless model relations for Backbone in < 1kb.

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/rjz/backbone.associate/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/rjz/backbone.associate?branch=master)

## Usage

Use `Backbone.associate` to define relationships between application models and
collections.

```js
var Flag = Backbone.Model.Extend({ /* ... */ }),
    City = Backbone.Model.Extend({ /* ... */ }),
    Cities = Backbone.Collection.extend({ model: City }),
    Country = Backbone.Model.Extend({ /* ... */ });

Backbone.associate(Country, {
  flag: { type: Flag },
  cities: { type: Cities, url: '/cities' }
});
```

Here, we're associating a model (`Country`) with two relations: a `Flag` model
and a collection of `Cities`. The association keys can be anything, but they
should match the keys used in the data that will be passed into the
application's `parse` method.

```js
var canada = new Country({
  url: '/countries/canada',
  flag: {
    colors: ['red','white']
  },
  cities: [
    { name: 'Calgary' },
    { name: 'Regina' }
  ]
});
```

When it's time to sync the parent resource back up with the server, child
resources can be serialized and included in the request.

```js
canada.toJSON(); // { flag: { colors: ['red','white'] }, ...
```


Since associates are *just attributes*, they may be accessed at any time using
the usual `get`.

```js
// GET /countries/canada/cities
canada.get('cities').fetch();
```


For the truly lazy, `associate` provides a convenient accessor for each
association:

```js
canada.flag().set({ colors: ['red','white'] });
canada.cities().add([
  { name: 'Edmonton' },
  { name: 'Montreal' },
  { name: 'Ottawa' },
  { name: 'Vancouver' }
]);
```


That's handy for manipulating the relations, setting up eventing, or any of the
many other things this plugin won't do for you. Speaking of which,

## Things this plugin won't do...

...include making any but the most basic presumptions about how it will be used.
Fortunately, all of these can be implemented as needed ([fiddle
here](http://jsfiddle.net/rjzaworski/79T94/)):

#### Identity mapping

```js
var getCountry = function (id) {
  _countries = {};
  return (getCountry = function (id) {
    if (!_countries[id]) {
      _countries[id] = new Country({ id : id });
    }
    return _countries[id];
  })(id);
};
```


#### Child events

```js
canada.onCityAdded = function (model) {
  console.log('city added!', model.get('name'));
}

canada.listenTo(canada.cities(), 'add', canada.onCityAdded);
```


## Testing

Specs are implemented with `jasmine-node`. After cloning this repo, install
dependencies and test with npm.

    $ npm install
    $ npm test

...and there's code coverage, too:

    $ npm run cover
